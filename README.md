PayDay is a Sponge plugin that pays players at set intervals.

## Usage

A configuration file (`payday.conf`) is located in the Sponge configuration directory, and allows you to modify how the plugin functions.

```
timeamount="1"
payonjoin="true"
enableafkpay="true"
timeunit=Hours
payamounts={
    "players"= {
        "permission"= "*",
        "amount"= 50.0
    }
}
salarymessage="&6[PayDay]: &7It's PayDay! Here is your salary of {amount} {label}! Enjoy!"
joinmessage="&6[PayDay]: &7Welcome to the server! Here is {amount} {label}! Enjoy!"
```

Valid time units are:

- `Nanoseconds`
- `Microseconds`
- `Milliseconds`
- `Seconds`
- `Minutes`
- `Hours`
- `Days`

Pay amounts are assigned using the following format:

```
payamounts={
    "my group"= {
        "permission"= "*",
        "amount"= 50.0
    },
    "my group 2"= {
        "permission"= "requires.this.permission",
        "amount"= 19.99
    }
}
```

If the permission is set to `*`, it will pay all players.

## Integration

If the `enableafkpay` is set to false in the configuration file, and the Nucleus AFK Module is enabled, PayDay will check if the player is AFK before paying them. If the player is found to be AFK, the player will not receive any currency.
